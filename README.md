## Projects

**Heart Disease Classification**  
A machine learning project focused on predicting heart disease based on various medical and clinical parameters.

**Pneumonia Classification**  
A deep learning project that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify chest X-ray images as normal or pneumonia.

**Spectral Filtering for Noise Suppression**  
An image processing project in which structured noise is reduced by preprocessing images in the spectral (frequency) domain.
